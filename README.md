# LearningGodot
Learning Godot and C#.

I will gather Godot and C# scripting examples along with Godot best practices (from my perspective) and other usage tips here. Learn, practice, and test! Everything will be under one Godot project for convenience. Each example will be separated into a self-contained scene. Each example will be well commented.
